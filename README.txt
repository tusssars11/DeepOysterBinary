#  DeepOysterBinary

This project uses deep learning (MobileNetV2) to classify oyster images into **binary categories**: `good` or `bad`. It includes training, evaluation, and explainability techniques (like Grad-CAM) to understand the model’s predictions and error patterns.

##  Model Overview

* **Model**: MobileNetV2 (transfer learning from ImageNet)
* **Task**: Binary classification (bad vs. good oysters)
* **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy with Logits
* **Optimizer**: Adam
* **Tools**: PyTorch, TorchVision, sklearn, seaborn, torchcam (Grad-CAM)

---

##  Results

* Achieved **77% accuracy** on the test set after fine-tuning.
* Significantly reduced loss from initial training phase.
* False positives analyzed using Grad-CAM visualizations to assess what regions the model focuses on.
* Applied model to clean and augmented test sets for consistency checks.

---

##  Next Steps

* Expand dataset by including **California oysters** (e.g., from Kaggle) to test model generalizability.
* Work with a project expert to **label more oyster data** or verify annotations.
* Transition from binary to **multi-class classification (5 oyster quality levels)** if more data becomes available.
